Kindergarten Read Lesson Words

Each week Mrs. Miller's Kindergarten class brings home words that they need
to practice reading. However, they are just written on a piece of paper and
out daughter has memorized the order of the words.

This simple web page is meant to combat that problem. The words are kept
in the same grouping as they are giving (colors together, numbers together, etc),
but they groups are presented in a random order and the words in each group
are in a random order. Color is randomly applied to the words to make sure they
are reading the color words, despite how they are colored on the screen.
